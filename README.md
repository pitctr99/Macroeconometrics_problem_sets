# Macroeconometrics_problem_sets
This is a repository containing the problem sets of the course "Macroeconometrics" (20532) held at Bocconi University, Milan. It mostly contains replication of seminal papers and codes on VAR implementation. Please note what follows:
1) Problem set 1 is just some simple computation on OLS and univariate time series processes (AR/MA/ARMA)
2) Problem set 2 contains the replication of the VAR implemented in Romer and Romer (2004) and to work it must be combined with the "Romer and Romer" xlsx file.
3) Problem set 3 contains the replication of Gal√¨ (1999) concerning the problem with hours in RBC models 
4) Problem set 4 is focused on Error Correction Mechanism (ECM) and the Johansen procedure.
These files were computed with the help of my collegues at the MSc course, which I thank very much.
